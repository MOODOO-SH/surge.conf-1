 Github: [https://github.com/crystoneme/surge.conf/](https://github.com/crystoneme/surge.conf/)

rules.conf: [download here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/crystoneme/surge.conf/master/rules.conf)

server.conf: [download here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/crystoneme/surge.conf/master/server.conf)


 These rules conf files are used for surge.app 1.0.0 Build 290 under iOS 9.0+

 The file rules.conf depend on file server.conf which defines your own proxy.

 It's for my own use purpose, consider some modification work to suitable for your own situation.
